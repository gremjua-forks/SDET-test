## Challenge
Create pilot Java test framework for testing NASA's open API (https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#getting-started). The purpose of the test is to check images which were made by Curiosity (https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#Images).
Test scenario:
1. Get first 10 Mars photos made by "Curiosity" on 1000 sol.
2. Get the same 10 Mars photos made by "Curiosity" on earth date that is equals 1000 Mars sol.
3. Compare downloaded images and metadata from API. Test fails in case of any difference.

As a plus:
Using NASAâ€™s API determine how many pictures were made by each camera (by Curiosity on 1000 sol.). If any camera made 10 times more images than any other - test fails.

Please use standard technologies, tools and frameworks which you are usually use in test frameworks creation. Please do not upload solution to your Github repository.

Implementation deadline is 1 week. Please let us know the time that you spent to achieve the task.
